FANTASIES
Albert Einstein once said, “The gift of fantasy has meant more to me
than my talent for absorbing positive knowledge.” Consequently,
Einstein was a profound and constant masturbator, which very few people
realize. His productivity would have been twice what it was if he could
manage to stave off his flooding fantasies. But we cannot deny the
dreaming mind. As human beings, we must feed it. And so we present to
you these choices in the far-off, far-out realms of fantasy. Choose wisely
(unlike Einstein).

WHO’D YOU RATHER…?
Across the animal kingdom, choosing an appropriate mate is vital to
help ensure the survival of a species. Male humpback whales race in an
array of flips and stunts so the female can select the mate with the strongest
genes, while peacocks fan their magnificent tail feathers to show peahens
who’s got the most impressive plumed booty. For human beings, choosing a
mate (whether it’s for life or for a one night stand) is also a skill that must
be honed. While the survival of the species may not be at stake, the survival
of your self-respect, dignity, and disease-free genitals might be. With this in
mind, we offer you the chance to sharpen your natural selection skills, by
serving up these difficult dilemmas concerning possible partners. As
always, you must choose. Abstinence is not an option.

WHAT WOULD YOU BE?
How to Use This Chapter
Game 1: I Am Thinking of Someone We All Know. This is a way to use
this chapter as a group game. One player thinks of someone who everybody
in the group knows: a friend, a coworker, an enemy, a teacher, etc. This is
the “name on the table.” Other players take turns reading a randomly
selected page of questions from this chapter. The player who is thinking of
someone answers each question as if he were that person. After every page,
have a player guess who you are thinking of. Optional: If you want, you can
all write down a bunch of people you know on scraps of paper, turn them
over, and have the answerer pull a name from the pile.
Game 2: Conversation. Pretty simple. Read a question and answer it as
yourself. If there is a group of you, everybody should answer the question.
Suggest your own answers for what you think others are and discuss why.
See who agrees and who disagrees. Debate. Deliberate. Arm-wrestle. Think
about other people you know (your friends, family, bosses, etc.) and what
they would be. When the conversation fades into silence and awkward
stares—you guessed it—it’s time to move on to the next question.
Game 3: Celebrity. Go back a page. Reread the directions for Game 1, but
substitute “celebrity” for “someone who everybody in the group knows.”

Game 4: Ninja Strike. Find a horde of bandits marauding caravans. Train
in the martial arts, specializing in book warfare. Fashion this book into a
throwing star or other deadly piece of weaponry. Defeat marauders.
If you were a company, what would you be?
If you were something that goes in the mouth, what would you be?
If you were a cooking technique (grilling, broiling, slow-cook, etc.),
what would you be?
If you were any palindrome (race car, mom, dad, etc.), what would you
be?

WOLD YOU…?
“Everybody has a price… for the million dollar man.”
—D.H. Lawrence
There’s no such thing as a free lunch. Unless you feign interest in buying
foods at Whole Foods where they are serving up free samples. That’s it
though: free samples at Whole Foods. Or I guess if you go to an art opening
and eat all the cocktail food pretending to be interested in the art. But that’s
it: art openings and Whole Foods free samples. That’s all. And wakes. You
don’t pay for wakes. Okay, so there are lots of free lunches. But not in this
case. Here, there is a price to pay for whatever it is that you want.

LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE…
The world don’t move to the beat of just one drum,
What might be right for you might not be right for some.
— Henry David Thoreau
Time to play Deity. The laws of the nation, of nature, of convention will
soon bend at your whimsical will. Of course, the great Godthings of the
Universe are not completely ceding their Rule. They are handing you two
choices with which you may shape the planet. The final decision, however,
is in your hands, which, by the way, you are presently fiendishly rubbing
together, drunk with power.
